# REPOS.md Example

**Copy this file to `repos/REPOS.md` and customize with your actual repositories.**

This file helps Claude understand which repositories are available when operating in multi-repo mode. It serves as a catalog for repository discovery and context.

## Guidelines

1. **Keep it updated**: Add new repositories as you onboard them to repo-sherpa
2. **Be descriptive**: Help Claude understand what each repo does
3. **Use absolute paths**: Ensure paths match what's in `bot_config.yaml`
4. **Team context**: Including team names helps Claude route questions appropriately
5. **Tech stack**: List key technologies to help Claude understand code patterns
